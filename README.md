## In this study a white blood cell image classifier was developed.
  #### • The initial data set of around 360 images was augmented through different methods to increase the training/testing set.
 #### • Several architectures and parameters were tested through gradual increase of the model capacity and final model was selected for the final training / testing. The simple architecture of the final achieved equally good results in comparison to more complex architectures used on the same data set that can be found online.
 #### • Additionally, CNN layers output of untrained network was visualized to better understand the classification process.
 #### • The final model scored 92% on validation set and on 93% on testing set, which is satisfactory, and the model could be deployed for simple medical applications that support manual cell identification.
 #### • Assumptions and limitations of the final model were discussed, among which the size of the original data set was identified as the most limiting factor in the model robustness.
 #### • Recommendations for the future developments were proposed to make the classifier more robust, versatile and accurate.
